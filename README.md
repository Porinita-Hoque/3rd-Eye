## <p align="center">3rd-Eye : Smart Eyeglass for the Blind</p>

<p align="justify">Communication is one of the greatest obstacles faced by individuals with visual impairments, as they struggle to interpret facial expressions. In this report, we present the "3rd Eye," a specialized eyeglass designed specifically for the visually impaired. Built using Python and OpenCV, this innovative eyeglass is capable of accurately detecting facial expressions. By utilizing the Haar Cascades Classifier, the "3rd Eye" can distinguish between five different emotions displayed on a person's face. The detected emotions are then conveyed to the visually impaired individual through integrated headphones. To convert the detected emotions into speech, we have employed ESpeak, a text-to-speech synthesizer. This project aims to provide visually impaired individuals with the ability to perceive the emotions of their loved ones and enhance communication.<p>
